# PUL Training Curriculum

When we began hiring student software engineers, we developed a training
curriculum in html / css, javascript, ruby, and rails. We evaluated the
software development training materials available at the time and purchased licenses for
[Treehouse](https://teamtreehouse.com), which is the basis of most of these training modules. We now want to
use these training modules for other purposes, so we're breaking the curriculum
into its component parts so they may be used in any relevant combination or order.

Time estimates provided are usually based on video play times and are for
planning purposes and approximation only. They are not expectations,
requirements, or rubrics. Please take the time needed to understand the
material, which may include seeking out additional resources or toy problems.
